# IgniteBCH - YC Pitch Deck

## What it does

**IgniteBCH is a fair launch platform for tokens on Bitcoin Cash. Anyone can create a token in 30 seconds with one click, and traders can buy/sell with guaranteed liquidity via bonding curves.**

Think of it as pump.fun for Bitcoin Cash — but with 100x lower fees and built-in social features.

## The problem

**Creating tokens is broken:**

1. **Expensive** - Launching on Ethereum costs $500-5000 in gas
2. **Unfair** - Developers pre-mine and dump on retail
3. **Risky** - 90% of new tokens are rug pulls
4. **Boring** - No community engagement tools

**Current options force a choice:**
- Cheap but centralized (CeFi)
- Fair but expensive (Ethereum)
- Fun but no social (pump.fun)

---

## The solution

**Three core innovations:**

1. **Bonding Curve Pricing**
   - Price = supply × slope (linear)
   - No slippage, no manipulation
   - Always liquid, no order books

2. **Locked Liquidity**
   - 800M tokens locked in smart contract
   - Liquidity unlocks only at graduation
   - No rug pulls possible

3. **SocialFi Built-in**
   - Real-time comments (P2P via Gun.js)
   - Token likes and community signals
   - Viral discovery mechanics

**Result:** The cheapest, fairest, most social token launch platform in crypto.

## Why now

**Three converging trends:**

1. **Bitcoin Cash is ready**
   - $10B market cap, minimal DeFi
   - CashTokens enabled smart contracts (2023)
   - Community hungry for innovation

2. **Memecoin supercycle**
   - pump.fun did $500M+ volume in 6 months
   - Retail demand at all-time high
   - Fair launch narrative winning

3. **AI lowers barriers**
   - AI generates logos, names, descriptions
   - Token creation becomes creative expression
   - Lower technical barrier = more creators
