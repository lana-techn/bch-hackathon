## Demo Flow

### **Part 1: Introduction (30 seconds)**

**Script:**
> "Hi everyone! Today I'm showing you IgniteBCH - the fairest way to launch tokens on Bitcoin Cash.
>
> The problem with most token launches? They're expensive, unfair, and risky. Ethereum costs $500+ in gas fees. Developers pre-mine and dump on retail. 90% are rug pulls.
>
> IgniteBCH solves this with three innovations:
> 1. **Bonding curves** - guaranteed liquidity, no slippage
> 2. **Locked liquidity** - no rug pulls possible
> 3. **$1.50 launch cost** - 100x cheaper than Ethereum
>
> Let me show you how it works."

---

### **Part 2: Token Discovery (45 seconds)**

**Actions:**
1. Show homepage with token list
2. Point to "King of the Hill" (largest token)
3. Scroll through token cards
4. Click on a token to show detail page

**Script:**
> "This is the homepage. You can see all live tokens here.
>
> [Point to King of the Hill]
> This is the current leader - the token with the highest market cap.
>
> [Scroll through tokens]
> Each token shows:
> - Current price
> - 24-hour change
> - Market cap
> - Number of holders
>
> [Click on a token]
> Let's look at one in detail..."

**On Token Detail Page:**
> "Here you can see:
> - Real-time price chart
> - Trading volume
> - Graduation progress (this token is 45% to graduating to DEX)
> - Live comments from the community
> - And most importantly - the trade panel
>
> Anyone can buy or sell instantly. The bonding curve guarantees liquidity."

---

### **Part 3: Create a Token (2 minutes)**

**Actions:**
1. Click "Create Token" button
2. Connect wallet (Paytaca)
3. Fill form with AI assistance

**Script:**
> "Now let me create a token. It takes 30 seconds.
>
> [Click Create Token]
> First, I need to connect my wallet.
>
> [Click Connect Wallet → Paytaca]
> I'm using Paytaca - a Bitcoin Cash wallet with full CashTokens support.
>
> [Wallet connects]
> Great! Now I have 0.05 BCH - more than enough.
>
> [Start filling form]
> Let me create a token called... 'RocketCat'
> Ticker: RCAT
>
> [Click AI Generate Image]
> Instead of designing a logo myself, I'll use AI.
>
> [Wait 10-15 seconds]
> And there we go! DALL-E generated a professional logo in seconds.
>
> [Click AI Generate Description]
> I can also auto-generate the description...
>
> [Description appears]
> Perfect! 'RocketCat - Purr-fect crypto that rockets to the moon! 🚀🐱'
>
> [Review form]
> Everything looks good. The cost is just 0.005 BCH - about $1.50.
>
> [Click Launch Token]
> Let's launch it!"

**During Deployment:**
> "The smart contract is now deploying in 4 steps:
> 1. Pre-Genesis - creates the token category
> 2. Genesis - issues the minting NFT
> 3. Mint - creates 1 billion tokens
> 4. Lock - locks 800 million to the bonding curve
>
> [Wait for completion]
> And... done! The token is live and trading immediately."

---

### **Part 4: Trade the Token (1 minute)**

**Actions:**
1. Navigate to newly created token
2. Show trade panel
3. Execute a buy transaction

**Script:**
> "Let's trade it right away.
>
> [On token page]
> Here's my new token - already live with a bonding curve.
>
> [Show trade panel]
> The trade panel shows:
> - Current price (starts very low)
> - How many tokens I'll receive
> - Trading fee (1%)
> - Price impact
>
> [Enter amount: 0.01 BCH]
> Let me buy 0.01 BCH worth...
>
> [Show calculation]
> I'll receive about 10 million tokens.
>
> [Click Buy]
> [Sign transaction in wallet]
>
> [Transaction confirms]
> Done! I now own 10 million RCAT tokens.
>
> The price automatically increased because of the bonding curve. Early buyers get the best price - but there's no pre-mine, no insider allocation. Everyone starts equal."

---

### **Part 5: Social Features (45 seconds)**

**Actions:**
1. Scroll to comments section
2. Post a comment
3. Like the token

**Script:**
> "IgniteBCH isn't just trading - it's social.
>
> [Scroll to comments]
> Every token has a live comment stream. This runs on Gun.js - a decentralized P2P database. No central server.
>
> [Type comment: 'RCAT to the moon! 🚀']
> [Post comment]
>
> [Comment appears instantly]
> Comments sync in real-time across all users.
>
> [Click like button]
> You can also like tokens to show community support.
>
> This creates viral discovery - the best tokens rise to the top organically."

---

### **Part 6: Graduation Explained (45 seconds)**

**Actions:**
1. Show graduation progress bar
2. Explain mechanics

**Script:**
> "Here's the magic part - graduation.
>
> [Point to progress bar]
> When a token reaches 40 BCH market cap (about $12,000), it automatically graduates to a decentralized exchange.
>
> What happens:
> - 200 million tokens (20% of supply) unlock
> - They pair with BCH in a liquidity pool
> - The token lists on the open market
> - Price discovery continues beyond the bonding curve
>
> This means successful tokens aren't stuck on IgniteBCH forever. They graduate to the wider DeFi ecosystem.
>
> And because liquidity is locked in the smart contract, rug pulls are impossible. The creator can't withdraw funds."

---

### **Part 7: Closing (30 seconds)**

**Script:**
> "So that's IgniteBCH:
>
> ✅ Create tokens in 30 seconds with AI
> ✅ Trade with guaranteed liquidity
> ✅ $1.50 launch cost (100x cheaper than Ethereum)
> ✅ No rug pulls - liquidity is locked
> ✅ Social features built-in
> ✅ Auto-graduation to DEX
>
> We're live on testnet now, mainnet launching soon.
>
> The unfair advantage in crypto ends here. Fair launches for everyone.
>
> Questions?"

## Demo Tips

### Do's:
✅ Practice the flow 2-3 times before demo  
✅ Have backup token names ready  
✅ Keep energy high and pace quick  
✅ Show real transactions (testnet is fine)  
✅ Emphasize the "30 seconds" and "$1.50" numbers  
✅ Point out the AI features - they're unique  

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't get stuck on technical details  
❌ Don't wait too long for AI generation (have backup images)  
❌ Don't apologize for testnet - it's the same UX  
❌ Don't skip the social features - they differentiate us  
❌ Don't forget to mention the graduation mechanism  

---

## Backup Plans

### If AI image generation fails:
> "The AI is taking a bit longer - let me use a pre-made image instead. In production, DALL-E generates these in 10-15 seconds."

### If wallet connection fails:
> "Let me reconnect... [try again]. Wallet integrations can be finicky in demos, but in production this is one-click."

### If transaction is slow:
> "Bitcoin Cash transactions confirm in seconds, but testnet can be slower. On mainnet, this would be instant."

## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions:

**Q: How do you prevent spam tokens?**
> A: The 0.005 BCH launch fee ($1.50) prevents spam while staying accessible. Compare to Ethereum's $500+ gas fees.

**Q: What if no one buys my token?**
> A: The bonding curve guarantees liquidity. You can always sell back to the curve, though at a lower price if you're the only buyer.

**Q: How do you make money?**
> A: 1% trading fee on all buys/sells, split 50/50 between platform and token creator. Plus the 0.005 BCH launch fee.

**Q: Why Bitcoin Cash instead of Ethereum/Solana?**
> A: Three reasons:
> 1. 100x cheaper fees ($0.0001 vs $5-50)
> 2. CashTokens are native - no complex smart contracts needed
> 3. Instant confirmations (0-conf)

**Q: What about security/audits?**
> A: Smart contracts are open source and audited. Bonding curve math is simple and verifiable. No admin keys - fully decentralized.

**Q: Can tokens be listed on other exchanges?**
> A: Yes! After graduation, tokens are standard CashTokens that any DEX can list.
